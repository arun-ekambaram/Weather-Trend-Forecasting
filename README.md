# Weather Trend Forecasting  

## Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing weather data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building a forecasting model using time series techniques.  

## Steps Involved  

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Handle missing values and outliers.  
- Normalize numerical data for consistency.  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Identify trends and correlations.  
- Visualize temperature and precipitation distributions.  

### 3. Model Building  
- Develop a forecasting model using `last_updated` for time series analysis.  
- Implement Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for trend analysis.  

### 4. Evaluation  
- Assess model performance using MAE and RMSE metrics.  

## Key Features  
- Histogram and Boxplot visualizations for temperature and precipitation.  
- Time series forecasting to predict future weather trends.  
- Uses Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for trend analysis.  

## How to Use  
1. Load the dataset.  
2. Run the preprocessing and EDA scripts.  
3. Train the forecasting model.  
4. Evaluate performance and interpret results.  

## Requirements  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn, Statsmodels  

## Results  
- **MAE:** 3.56  
- **RMSE:** 4.61  

Lower values indicate better predictions. Further tuning may improve results.
