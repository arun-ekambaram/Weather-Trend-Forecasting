Weather Trend Forecasting

Overview

This project focuses on analyzing weather data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building a forecasting model using time series techniques.

Steps Involved

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handle missing values and outliers.

Normalize numerical data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identify trends and correlations.

Visualize temperature and precipitation distributions.

Model Building

Develop a forecasting model using last_updated for time series analysis.

Implement Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for trend analysis.

Evaluation

Assess model performance using MAE and RMSE metrics.

Key Features

Histogram & Boxplot visualizations for temperature & precipitation.

Time series forecasting to predict future weather trends.

Uses Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for trend analysis.

How to Use

Load the dataset.

Run the preprocessing and EDA scripts.

Train the forecasting model.

Evaluate performance and interpret results.

Requirements

Python

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn, Statsmodels

Results

MAE: 3.56

RMSE: 4.61

Lower values indicate better predictions. Further tuning may improve results.
